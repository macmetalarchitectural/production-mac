Product Attribute Paint Type
============================
This module adds a text field `Paint Type` on the product attribute list view.

The field is used on purchase orders for telling the supplier what type of paint to use for a product.

Using the field in reports
--------------------------
To display the paint type in reports (i.e. from a purchase order line), you may adapt and use the following code:

`line.product_id.paint_type`
